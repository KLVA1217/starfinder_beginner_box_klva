# Scoundrels in the Spike CYOA

An attempt to create a CYOA style game out of the Solo Adventure module in the Hero's Handback of the Beginner Box.

###### 10-11-2023 2348 Update
Created a simple CYOA framework for two events.  
Game will only load next even if the option inputted is valid.  
Events are to made created using the events.txt. As a side note inputting the paragraphs is going to suck.  

###### 10-12-1339 2348 Update
Implemented:
- character and player classes
- updated events to handle characters for comabt
- Game now asks for your name
- Simple but automatic combat system
- for certain entries depending on the results of combat after user presses enter game will automatically take the user to the appropriate entry.

To work on next time:
- Entry/Event Logic to see if character has explored it and if so go the appropriate option
