The following entries need explored options:
    5
    6
    7
    9

If going to entry one, always reset the game!
    Currently most likely works...
        Still needs further testing...

Implement Skill Checks:

Entries that require skill checks:
    17 (Slightly more complicated as it also requires checking the hp...)

Implement Hidden Options until conditions have been met:
    11
    13
    14
    15

Once at the last entry, user must enter anything to exit the game

If the user enters x, ask if they want to leave the game, warn them that progress is not saved (saving is a feature to be implementec), after confirmation exit the game.
